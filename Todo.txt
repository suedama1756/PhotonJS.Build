To enable support for custom wrappers, dynamic code etc. we will add support for virtual files into the
module file list.

Example: Demonstrates writing strict and non strict sections within the module.

files : [
    function(writer) {
    	writer.writeln('(function() {');
    	writer.indent(1);
    	writer.writeln('"use strict";');
    },
    'file01',
    'file02',
    'file03',
    function(writer} {
        writer.indent(-1);
        writer.writeln('})();');
    }
]

This approach will give us the maximum degree of flexibility.

In addition to this we will also support "use strict" out of the box, we should probably default to use strict === true.
